National Map Embedded in GeoNetwork
===================================

This the NICTA National Map project embedded in GeoNetwork (ANZMEST) replacing the rather dated and
tired extjs open layers map interface. 

Basic installation instructions for ANZMEST GeoNetwork 2.10.4 (Assuming you've already installed
anzmest):

- clone nationalmap from the anzmest github project: git clone --recursive https://github.com/anzmest/nationalmap
- copy nationalmap into your GeoNetwork installation at webapps/geonetwork/apps/nationalmap
- build nationalmap as per the instructions on the nationalmap wiki (see below)

More about [National Map](http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au).

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/NICTA/ausglobe/wiki) for 
more information about National Map and how to build and run it.
